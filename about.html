            Routes North is an independent travel guide covering Sweden, 
            Denmark, Finland and Norway. Founded in 2014, its aim is 
            simple: to help travellers get the most out of a trip to the
            region regardless of their budget. No messing about – just 
            helpful, honest travel advice. <br>

            Unlike the vast majority of publications writing about 
            Scandinavia, we do not take free stuff or discounts on 
            travel services. Why? Because it means we’re free to say
             what we really think. <br>

            All of the hotels, restaurants and attractions reviewed on
             this website have been visited in person, anonymously. 
             Routes North was started by the British journalist Steve 
             Vickers, who has worked on more than 15 guidebooks across
              Europe and Asia and has spent the past eight years 
              exploring Scandinavia. The site now attracts more than 130,
              000 unique users a month. Want to say hi? Contact us via
